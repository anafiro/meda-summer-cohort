A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME!
First paragraph: 
I am Anahita Firoozi. Anahita is my full name. As far as I remember, most  of people call me, Ana. Therefore, Please feel free to call me, Ana. I am from Persia.  I graduated from college and my major in college was science. I worked about 10 years ( The  link--- Please see my resume to find out more about me)  before coming to the USA.  I speak Farsi. I write Farsi from right to left. Since Middle school, I have been always interested in learning a foreign language, especially English. So, you probably can guess what is one of my hobbies by now. 

Second paragraph: 
My first hobby is learning a foreign language. I mostly enjoy learning English as my second language because it provides a broader access to education and information. These days, most of information are in English.
The second hobby that I really enjoy is traveling. The main reason is that it gives a chance to get to know people from different cultures and learn different things from them.

2) Contact me

An example of Portfolio I found online :
Floatleft.com/portfolio/

Likes: The thing that I liked about this individual portfolio is that he has like twitter icons and other icons that it is linked to the, for example twitter webpage.  It is has a header and footer sections that are recognizable and has his logo and menu bar.

Dislikes: The thing that I have been really confused about is by looking at his home page I can not tell exactly what is about and if it belongs to an individual or not. The main includes I guess bunch of other portfolios from other individuals!!
