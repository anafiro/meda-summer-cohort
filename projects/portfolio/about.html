        <h1>A Littile about Me!</h1>
        <p>My name is Anahita Firoozi. Anahita is my full name. But, as far as I remember, most  of people call me, Ana.I am from Persia. I am currently sudent at MEDA learning web programming. Prior to this, I graduated from college and my major in college was science. I worked about 10 years<a href="photo/Firooziresume.pdf">,HERE IS MY RESUME,</a> before coming to the USA. I speak Farsi and write Farsi from right to left. Since Middle school, I have been always interested in learning a foreign language. So, you probably can guess what one of my hobbies is by now.
         </p>

        <p>My first hobby is learning a foreign language. I mostly enjoy learning English as my second language because it provides a broader access to education and information. These days, most of information are in English.The second hobby that I really enjoy is traveling. The main reason for this is that it gives me a chance to get to know people from different countries and cultures Therefore, I learn new and different things from them.</p>
