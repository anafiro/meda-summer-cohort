        <h1>FINDING OUT ABOUT MY HOBBY!</h1>


        <h2>INTRODUCTION-HOBBY</h2>

            <p>This is Anahita. Anahita is my full name. As far as I remember, most of people call me, Ana.
                Therefore, Please feel free to call me, Ana. I am from Persia. I speak Farsi. I write Farsi
                from right to left. Since Middle school, I have been always interested in learning a foriegn 
                language, especially English. So, you probably can guess what is my hobby by now. My hobby is 
                learning a foriegn language. I mostly enjoy learning English as my second language because 
                it provides a broader access to  education and information. These days, most of information
                are in English.
            </p>


        <h2>A FEW TIPS TO LEARN A FORIEGN LANGUAGE</h2> 

            <p>The most important tip that I am recommending about learning a foriegn language is the practice. One
                way is to engaged in the coversation with people. Eventhough conversation plays a bigger role in 
                learning a foriegn language, but understanding the meaning of words is also important. So you need 
                to have a dictionary handy. The next step is learning grammer so by learning it you would be able 
                to create a meaning full sentences. These days, it is easier to find good resources mostly avaliable
                online epecially in modern countries. But back then when I started learning English as my second, I did not 
                have access to online resources beccuase it was not avalible to everybody. so I had to either borrow or
                buy less expensive books. On eithr way, if ones need to learn something, she or he eventually finds a 
                learn regardless of being avalible online or not.
            </p>
         <h2>ONLINE RESORUES TO LEARN A FORIEGN LANGUAGE</h2> 

           
            <p> There are many online resources that are avalible. Some of them are free of charge. But, the rest the 
                consumer should pay for it either all at once or on monthly bases. I have heard about Rosetta Stone 
                resource which I had access to it as a book like a grammer since I started learning English back home. 
                But, I do not know much about other resouces like Babbel and FluentU as much as Rosetta Stone. I searched online 
                and these two resources were avalible resouces. As I read in their website about their services, I think that
                they might be useful for people who are intersted in learning a foriegn language. Therefore, here are the 
                Rosetta Stone, Babbel, and Fluentu links as are listed below:</p>

            
            <ul>
