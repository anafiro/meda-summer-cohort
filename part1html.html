        <h2>HTML</Lh2>
            <p>HTML is used to describe the content of web pages. HTML stands for HyperText Markup
                Language, and it is the primary language for websites, along with CSS, and optionally,
                JavaScript. A webpage is split into two categories: Content and Design. HTML is
                responsible for the Content, so we will not be working with colors, font sizes or
                positioning, instead HTML is only used to describe what is displayed on the web page.</p>

        <h2>HTML SYNTAX</h2> 
        <p> Just like we put together letters into groups to create words, HTML is grouped up into
            “tags”, a tag has a keyword that is surrounded by angle brackets (&lt;and&gt;). There
            are certain keywords that make up the language of HTML.</p>
            <p> Correctly written HTML tags:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>&lt;html&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;blockquote&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;body&gt;</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Incorrectly written HTML tags:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>/&gt;html&lt;</li>
                <li>&lt;blockquote</li>
                <li>body</li>
            </ul>
